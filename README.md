# AccentClassifier
This project implements an **audio classification pipeline** that leverages deep learning techniques to automatically identify and categorize audio clips into predefined classes. The model is trained on preprocessed audio features extracted from `.wav` files, enabling it to classify sounds such as speech, environmental noises, &amp; other sound events.
